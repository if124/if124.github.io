<!-- This is a brief rundown of the code below. I started off this assignment with the intention to make the
page serve as a promotional page for a music video that an artist had created. With that in mind, I sought out
to find the things that I felt were required in a page like so. Elements that should be within the page includes:

- Media Player with timeline
- Volume Controls
- Playback Controls
- Artist Bio
- Like Counter

You will see as you peruse the code that some of these elements fell short, but that's fine. You will also see
the different things I tried to do in my process of making this page. As of now, this is what I've got. Further
details regarding each section of the code is discussed along the way.
