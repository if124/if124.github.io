    <div class="question">
    What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?
    </div>
       
    <div class="answer">
      The experience encapsulates a face-to-face interaction with the creator in my opinion. By
      presenting the content within a laptop element, it makes me feel like he's directly presenting
      his work to me in-person. Additionally, the experience references video with the transitioning
      between pages being animated and the assets moving upon interaction. 
    </div>
   
    <div class="question">
    What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?
    </div>
   
    <div class="answer">
      Looking at this reference of a face-to-face interaction makes me want to intently see what the
      creator is showing me. That is of course desirable because the website is a portfolio. Doing so
      would ultimately allow the creator to accomplish the goal of showing his talents. Looking at the
      moving assets within the experience makes me want to look for more things that can move within
      the website itself.  
    </div>
   
    <div class="question">
    What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </div>
       
    <div class="answer">
      These references tell me that I should be contemplative to the creator's work. It informs me
      that I should look at the contents of the website in an objective manner. The moving assets
      that refer to video also tells me that I should feel engaged and excited when interacting with
      the experience. 
    </div>
   
    <div class="question">
    What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?
    </div>
          
    <div class="answer">
    The photos that are tethered to the headings to lead users to another page are not clickable. It is
    frustrating because that visual element is more prominent than the text it is connected to, not making
    it clickable just wastes an opportunity for more clickable real estate within the page. 
    </div>
   
    <div class="question">
    What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
    </div>
          
    <div class="answer">
    The animations within the website from the transitioning between pages to the scrolling between
    screens within pages are very satisfying to look at. This is because every animation on the website
    appears to be carefully created to be as smooth as possible. As a person who values the smoothness
    of an app's animations, this was very pleasing to look at.
