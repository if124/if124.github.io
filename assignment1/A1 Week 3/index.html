       <div class="question">
        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?
       </div>
       
       <div class="answer">
        The experience references coding in the form of the creator's resume. He showcases his coding
        expertise through the experience itself. Additionally, the experience references video with the
        transitioning between pages being animated and the assets moving upon interaction. 
       </div>
   
       <div class="question">
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?
          </div>
   
          <div class="answer">
            Looking at this reference to coding tells me that I should be more inclined to look out for
            coding-related materials within the experience. Doing so would ultimately allow the creator
            to accomplish the goal of showing his talent in coding. Looking at the moving assets within
            the experience makes me want to look for more things that can move within the website itself.  
        </div>
   
       <div class="question">
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?
       </div>
       
       <div class="answer">
        The reference to coding tells me that I should be contemplative to the creator's work. A look
        into the moving assets that refer to video tells me that I should feel engaged when interacting with the experience. 
       </div>
   
       <div class="question">
        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?
          </div>
          
       <div class="answer">
        The photos that are tethered to the headings to lead users to another page are not clickable. It is
        frustrating because that visual element is more prominent than the text it is connected to, not making
        it clickable just wastes an opportunity for more clickable real estate within the page. 
       </div>
   
       <div class="question">
        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
          </div>
          
       <div class="answer">
        The animations within the website from the transitioning between pages to the scrolling between
        screens within pages are very satisfying to look at. This is because every animation on the website
        appears to be carefully created to be as smooth as possible. As a person who values the smoothness
        of an app's animations, this was very pleasing to look at.
