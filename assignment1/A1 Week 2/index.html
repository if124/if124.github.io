 <p class="question-text"> 
    What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
 </p>
    
  <p class="answer-text"> 
    The fly tethering to the cursor was the first thing that I noticed. Having something like
    that to follow the cursor is a way to make the website feel more engaging & fun. 
  </p>

<p class="question-text"> 
    Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Clicking</li>
    <li>Scrolling</li>
    <li>Hovering</li>
</ol>

<p class="question-text"> 
    What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
</p>

<p class="answer-text"> 
    Playing around with the cursor to make the fly follow it was what I spent the most time on. 
</p>

<p class="question-text"> 
    What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?
</p>

<p class="answer-text"> 
    Clicking on buttons and going back to the Home Screen. 
</p>

<p class="question-text"> 
    What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
</p>

<p class="answer-text"> 
    I feel like the interactive experience was to show viewers of the creators' portfolio and his
    capabilities in web design. With this experience, I believe that the creator delivered the intended
    primary goal well because it made me (the user) explore the website more as I went through each page. 
</p>

<p class="question-text"> 
    How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
</p>

<p class="answer-text"> 
    Using animations to fade in/out the pages provided more visual flair to the experience. That aided
    in conveying this primary goal. To have a fly that interacts with the user's input also allowed the
    primary goal of showing the creator's capabilities when it came to delivering an interactive experience. 
</p>

<p class="question-text"> 
    What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?
    (For how long and howmany different times) 
</p>

<p class="answer-text"> 
    I feel like there could be more that could be done it terms of interactivity because as of now, the experience
    is mostly clicking, scrolling and returning to home screen. That can only engage a user for so long, probably
    not more than 10 minutes. Not that there is nothing wrong with the loop, but there could be more done to break
    the loop and engage the user more. 
</p>

<p class="question-text"> 
    How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?
</p>

<p class="answer-text"> 
    With clickable words that are consistent in font and style, it allows the user to learn over time that words in
    the same design style are clickable. Arrows that point in the direction of the scroll also teaches the user of
    the scrolling opportunities on a page. Lastly, a clickable logo on the top right corner of each page that goes
    back to the home screen tells the user that that is the way to go back to Home every time.
