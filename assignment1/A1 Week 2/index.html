     <h1>Week 2</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
     What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
        The fly tethering to the cursor was the first thing that I noticed. Having something
        like that to follow the cursor is a way to make the website feel more engaging and fun.
        This is because the fly constantly moves, and that adds flair to an otherwise static website. 
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
       </div>

    <div class="table">
        <ol>
            <li>Clicking</li>
            <li>Scrolling</li>
            <li>Hovering</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
        Playing around with the cursor to make the fly follow it was what I spent the most time
        engaging with. Doing so enabled more time to be spent within the website, which is the main
        goal for the creator. However, the introduction of the fly is kind of a double-edged sword
        because with it being so engaging, users may miss the main point of the experience, which is
        to showcase the creator's talents and works. 
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?
       </div>
       
    <div class="answer">
        Clicking on buttons was the most common action, mainly because doing so allowed me to
        navigate between pages within the experience. 
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
       </div>
       
    <div class="answer">
        I feel like the interactive experience was to show viewers of the creator's portfolio and
        his capabilities in web design. This was done via the use of coding to curate his works in
        a presentable and aesthetically pleasing manner within a website page. With this experience,
        I believe that the creator delivered the intended primary goal well because it made me (the
        user) explore the website more as I went through each page. That consequently got me to
        observe his capabilities in the skills he is offering.  
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
       </div>
       
    <div class="answer">
        Using animations to fade in/out the pages provided more visual flair to the experience. That
        aided in conveying this primary goal. To have a fly that interacts with the user's input also
        allowed the primary goal of showing the creator's capabilities when it came to delivering an
        interactive experience. Finally, the uniform colour scheme across pages allowed a sense of
        standardisation and uniqueness to the creator. 
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?
        (For how long and howmany different times) 
       </div>
       
    <div class="answer">
        I feel like there could be more that could be done it terms of interactivity because as of now,
        the experience is mostly clicking, scrolling and returning to home screen. That can only engage
        a user for so long, probably not more than 10 minutes. Not that there is nothing wrong with the
        loop, but there could be more done to break the loop and engage the user more. However, the use
        of a scrolling page to showcase his works is very helpful in the long run because the creator
        could either just add his future projects below the existing ones or replace the ones that
        already exist with the new works. 
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?
       </div>
       
    <div class="answer">
        With clickable words that are consistent in font and style, it entrains the user to learn over
        time that words in the same design style are clickable. Arrows that point in the direction of
        the scroll also teaches the user of the scrolling opportunities on a page. Lastly, a clickable
        logo on the top right corner of each page that goes back to the home screen tells the user that
        that is the way to go back to Home every time.

    <!-- Added "Back to Home" button for navigation purposes -->

            <a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a>
