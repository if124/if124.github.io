<!-- The following code creates the Creative Process section of the website. This section features scrolling
 as a function. This was done to allow easy viewing of the process as users scroll down the page. Each image
 within the box can be hovered over, upon which a description of the image will be shown. To provide more clarity,
 instructions are given underneath the section heading. An overlay is also applied onto the description, providing
 better contrast between the desciptions and their respective images which subsequently allows better readability.
 The beginning part of each description is also bolded to aid in highlighting what the image is showing. -->

          <span style="font-weight:600">The Chosen Colours</span> were these three colours. Each of them represents a different
          feeling. Not listed in any order, these colours represent Nostalgia, Happiness, and Love.

          into others better.

        <div class="shapestext" id="text">
          <span style="font-weight:600">The Shape Experiments</span> involved the artist creating a whole catalogue of shapes
          to play around with, subsequently populating each one of them with each colour. Doing so enabled the artist to semantically
          assign each colour to a shape that he desired.

          <span style="font-weight:600">The Test with Magic Music Visuals</span> was done to test just what the software could do. The output from
          the test was not as desirable as the artist envisioned, so he decided to scrap the idea and utilise
          another software.

          <span style="font-weight:600">The After Effects Incorporation</span> was a period of enlightenment. This was where the artist managed to
          create the work with effective results. Using compositing witin After Effects, the chosen colours were able to
          ebb and flow according to what he had envisioned.

          <span style="font-weight:600">The GarageBand Implementation</span> involved getting visuals to work with the visuals created within After
          Effects. Careful consideration was carried out when deciding on what instruments to use to accompany
          those visuals. GarageBand was ultimately used to allow the artist play the accompanying audio according to the video.

          attributes such as reverb and sustain was edited using this plugin. The result was a piece of work
          that allowed resonance to occur within viewers.
