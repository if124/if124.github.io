          <span style="font-weight:600">The Chosen Colours</span> were these three colours. Each of them represents a different
          feeling. Not listed in any order, they are Nostalgia, Happiness and Love.

        <div class="flowcharttext" id="text">
          <span style="font-weight:600">The Colour Flowchart</span> involved playing around with these colours in order to see which colours flowed
          into others better.

        <div class="shapestext" id="text">
          <span style="font-weight:600">The Shapes Experiments</span> were an exercise that had the artist create a whole catalogue of shapes
          to play around with and let the colour populate it. Doing so enabled the artist to semantically
          assign each colour to a shape that he desired.

          <span style="font-weight:600">The Test with Magic Music Visuals</span> was done to test just what the software could do. The output from
          the test was not as desirable as the artist envisioned, so he decided to scrap the idea and utilise
          another software.

          <span style="font-weight:600">The After Effects Incorporation</span> was a period of enlightenment. This was where the artist managed to
          find a way to create the work he envisioned. By using After Effects, the chosen colours were able to
          ebb and flow as intended by him.

        <div class="garagebandtext" id="text">
          <span style="font-weight:600">The GarageBand Implementation</span> involved getting visuals to work with the visuals created within After
          Effects. Careful consideration was carried out when deciding on what instruments to use to accompany
          those visuals. GarageBand was used to allow the artist to see the visuals as they come and play the
          accompanying audio accordingly.

          <span style="font-weight:600">The GarageBand Plugin</span> called "LABS by Spitfire Audio" was utilised within the tracks created. Auditory
          attributes such as reverb and sustain was edited using this plugin. The result was a piece of work
          that allowed resonance to occur within viewers.
